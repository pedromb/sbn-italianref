    "## Italian Referendum 2016\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2016 the then Prime Minister of Italy, Matteo Renzi, called a constitutional referendum to reform the composition and powers of the Parliament of Italy, as well as the division of powers between the State, the regions, and administrative entities. The vote was held on 4th December of 2016. Voteres were given two options, yes or no. This project aims to analyse the Twitter interaction between the supporters of the two groups on the days that led to the referendum vote.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis is comprised of three steps. First we look at the temporal interaction between yes and no supporters. To do that we look at the tweets produced in Italy from 26th November of 2016 until 2nd December of 2016. We identify the main influencers (politicians and journalists) of the two groups and analyse the tweets produced by then along the timeframe. The goal of this step is to identify the temporal behaviour of the main themes discussed (through text analysis) of the two groups as well as possibly identify some kind of action-reaction interaction that happens between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step tries to idenfity the supporters of each group among all the Twitter users that produced content in the platform through the timeframe. To do that we look at users that mentioned influencers of each group, as well as looking at users that produced tweets with similar words of those used for the influences of each group. Besides that we use the given graph, which shows users that follow each other, to look for the main authorities, hubs and key players among the supporters for each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, using the given graph we try to identify the spread of influence of each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data with the tweets produced between 26th November of 2016 until 2nd December of 2016 and the follower-following graph were given as input of this project and are not a product of the analysis itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0. Data Pre Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting the analysis we indexed all the data available into a Lucene index. Besides indexing the information about the user and text of tweets we also processed the text to save the term vector for each tweet. This makes it faster to retrieve the data aftweards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Temporal Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 Influencers Support\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by manually identifying the main influencers for each group, yes and no. To do that we looked online on different sources to determine who were the main politicians and journalists, that were also Twitter users, that made their position public. With the goal to keep a balanced analysis we chose 120 influencers that supported NO, and 120 influences that supported YES. However, when we look at the number of tweets we can see that the NO supporters are more active, we get 16448 tweets by NO supporters and 14827 tweets for YES supporters, the table below shows a summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Support | Number of Users | Number of Tweets |\n",
    "|---------|-----------------|------------------|\n",
    "| Yes     |             120 |            14827 |\n",
    "| No      |             120 |            16448 |\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph below shows how is the distribution of number of tweets by support throughout the days.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"temporal_analysis/figures/temporal_distribution.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see a a similar temporal behaviour between both groups when it comes to the number of tweets produced on the days that led to the referendum day.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 Cluster of Words\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we take look at the actual text of the tweets produced by each group. To do that we retrieve the vector of terms from the Lucene index for each tweet of each user identified previously. After that we produce the [SAX](https://jmotif.github.io/sax-vsm_site/morea/algorithm/SAX.html) strings for each of the top 1000 words used by each group. To do that we use the [JMotif Java library](https://jmotif.github.io/sax-vsm_site/) that implements SAX algorithms. With the SAX strings we are able to run a K-Means algorithm to identify clusters of words based on their temporal behaviour. The algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set a number of clusters K (for this case we identified, empiracally, that K = 3 was a good option).\n",
    "2. Choose the K initial centroids (random SAX strings).\n",
    "3. Calculate the distance between each word and each centroid and assign the cluster according to the closest centroid.\n",
    "4. Define new centroids using the average (ASCII values) of each char of the SAX strings that comprise each cluster.\n",
    "5. Go back to 3 and repeat until the clusters don't change anymore or it reaches a limit of iteratinos ( determined to be 100 in our case).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the YES supporters we have the following word clouds for each cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"temporal_analysis/figures/clusters_yes.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "For cluster 1 we can see that the main words (by frequency) are \"renzi\", \"litalia\" and \"referendumcostituzionale\", which refers to then PM of Italy Matteo Renzi, who was responsible for calling the referendum and was also the main supporter for the Yes group. The main words for cluster 2 are \"grillo\", \"ms\", \"firmefalse\" among others, this refers to the political party \"Movimento 5 Stelle\" (M5S) and their leader, Bepper Grillo. The \"firmefalse\" refers to an investigation against the party in an electoral tampering case for faking and cloning citizen signatures in 2012 local elections. The case got a spotlight on the days before the referendum since the M5S was one of the main supporters for the No group. This shows that Yes supporters were trying to bring the issue to light in an effort to discredit their opposition. Finally, the main words for cluster 3 are \"referendum\", \"iovotosi\" and \"bastaunsi\", the last two were the main hashtags shared by the Yes supporters on the days that led to the referendum.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the NO supporters we have the following word clouds for each cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"temporal_analysis/figures/clusters_no.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "For cluster 1 we can see that the main words (by frequency) are \"riforma\", \"costituzione\" and besides that we can also see the words \"milakmperilno\" and \"lavoratoriperilno\" which were two big hashtags used by the group \"Lavoratori Per Il No\" which was a coordinated group supporting NO. The main word for cluster 2 is \"salvini\" which refers to the member of the Lega party, Matteo Salvini, he is an active Twitter user that supported the NO. Finally, on cluster 3 we see the main hashtags used by the No supporters, such as \"iovotono\" and \"iodicono\", besides that we also see the word \"renzi\", which shows that No supporters were also making their opinion about Matteo Renzi known.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3 Graph Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "For each cluster identified before we build a co-occurence graph. In this graph two words are connected if they appear in the same tweet, and the weight of the edge between them is the number of tweets that they appear together. After building the graph we extract the largest connected component and the innermost core (k-core) of each one. Since most of the words are connected, the largest connected component most of the times is the full graph, so this doesn't give us any new information. However, if we look at the k-core we can see the words that are more likely to show together in a tweet for each cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the words present in the k-core for each cluster we can see how they behave througout the time. The graph below shows the words in the k-core for each cluster for the YES supporters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"temporal_analysis/figures/k_cores_yes.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph below shows the words in the k-core for each cluster for the NO supporters.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"temporal_analysis/figures/k_cores_no.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the cluster 3 for each case seems to have similar behaviours, so lets compare them.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"temporal_analysis/figures/k_core_cluster_3.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph shows the aggregate for every word (with a confidence interval) in the k-core of cluster 3 for YES supporters and NO supporters. We can clearly see an action-reaction happening here. When NO supporters start to show they support there are massive responses from YES supporters, this is specially highlighted between the days 29 and 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Identifying Yes/No Supporters\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 Identifying Supporters\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we want to take a look at all the supporters, not only influencers, for each group. To do that we retrieve every tweet that mentioned one of the influencers as well as every tweet that had one of the main hashtags used by each group, for the YES supporters we use the hashtags \"iovotosi\", \"iodicosi\" and \"bastaunsi\", for NO supporters we use the hashtags \"iovotono\", \"iodicono\", \"bastaunno\". Finally, based on these tweets we give a support score for each user (the shows in the tweets retrieved) using the following score:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "S   = { (M_y + 3H_y) - (M_n + 3H_n) }\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- $M_y$ is the number of mentions of users that are yes supporters.\n",
    "- $M_n$ is the number of mentions of users that are no supporters.\n",
    "- $H_y$ is the number of times that YES hashtags are used.\n",
    "- $H_n$ is the number of times that NO hashtags are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "We give a higher weight to the use of hashtags since mentioning an influencer not always indicate support for what the influence supports. Finally, we classify each user using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "C = \\Bigg\\{\n",
    "      \\begin{array}{ll}\n",
    "          Yes & S > 10 \\\\\n",
    "          No & S < -10 \\\\\n",
    "          Neutral & -10\\leq S \\leq 10 \\\\\n",
    "     \\end{array}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "We were conservative when assigning the support to only keep the true supporters for each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "After setting the support for each user collected we have the following numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Support | Number of Users | Number of Tweets |\n",
    "|---------|-----------------|------------------|\n",
    "| Yes     |            3564 |           126698 |\n",
    "| No      |            7532 |           215501 |\n",
    "| Neutral |           40531 |            89381 |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that although most of the users are neutral, the most number of tweets are still concentrated between the YES and NO supporters. However, the number of actual NO supporters is almot double as the number of YES supporters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Authorities, Hubs and Key Players\n",
    "\n",
    "After identifying the users that support each option we want to highligh how are the authorities, hubs and key players for each group in the network. To do that we use the provided graph and the [G](https://github.com/giovanni-stilo/G/tree/master/src/main/java/it/stilo/g) library. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the users retrieved we generate the induced subgraph of the original graph and then we compute [HITS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HITS_algorithm) on the induced sugraph. To identify the authorities we simply look at the authority score given by the algorithm, for the hubs we use a combine metric between the hub score given by the algorithm and the support score S defined aboved. This new score, that we call centrality score (CS) is given by the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "CS  = { \\frac{2H + S}{3} }\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "- $H$ normalized (between 0 and 1) hub score.\n",
    "- $S$ normalized (between 0 and 1) support score.\n",
    "\n",
    "This represents a weighted average between the two scores given a higher weight for the hub score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Authorities in this case are the users who have a lot of followers and are more likely to drive the discusion among the supporters of the group. We exepect the top authorities to be among the influencers identified in part 1 of this analysis. Hubs, on the other hand, should be users that are active on Twittet, heavily support their group and follows a lot of the authorities of the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look at the top 10 authorities for each group:\n",
    "\n",

    "Finally, we want to identify the key players in the network. To do that we use the KPP-NEG algorithm, which identifies nodes that if removed from the network are more likely to disrupt or fragment the network.

    "### 3. Spread of Influence\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 Spread of Influence using Label Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "For the last step of our analysis we want to take a look at how is the spread of influence of each group. This can be seen as which group is more likely to influence the network through information sharing, in a way we can see this as which group is more likely to change the opinion of the other. To do that we developed two approaches, both of them are based on the label [propagation algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Label_Propagation_Algorithm). \n",
    "\n",
    "The first one, discussed in this section is the actual label propagation algorithm. We run the algorithm using three different seeds (initial labels). First using all the users identified as yes or no supporters (M - identified on section 2.1), secondly using the top 1000 hub users for each group (M' - identified on section 2.2), and finally using the top 500 key players for each group (K - identified on section 2.2).\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical label propagation algorithm was proposed for undirected graphs, in our case we have a directed graph, so when deciding which label to assign to a user we look at the users that he follows and their current label, so if a user follows more users that are assigned a YES label he would be assigned a YES label, and so on. For the first iteration of the algorithm for all the cases we would have \"Neutral\" users, however this label is not propagated througout the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following graphs show the distribution of labels throughout the iterations of the algorithm for each case. The algorithm would stop if no lables would change or if a maximum of 100 iterations was reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"spread_of_influence/figures/lpa_m.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"spread_of_influence/figures/lpa_m2.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see on the first graph that since the number of seed labels for the NO supporters are higher they start by increasing their influence in the network. However at around the 3rd iteration the YES supporters start increasing their influence whilst the NO supporters start to decline. If we look at the other graphs, when we start with a balanced number of seed labels the YES supporters spread their influence much faster, in all cases, eventually the NO supporters almost disappear. This can be explained because a lot of the influencers who support YES are highly connected to the network and tend to influence more the spread then those who support NO.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2 Spread of Influence using Modified Label Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we propose our own version of the Label Propagation algorithm. The proposed algorithm work as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assign the number of clusters (in this case 2, Yes or No).\n",
    "2. Define the initial clusters by using different seeds (as explained on 3.1)\n",
    "3. Define initial centroids for each cluster (randomly select one node for the Yes supporters and one for the No supporters).\n",
    "4. Update the clusters based on a metric Y and N. Assing the cluster Yes when Y > N, the cluster No when N > Y, and randomly choose one cluster when Y = N.\n",
    "5. Update the centroids.\n",
    "6. Stop the iterations when no label change or if a maximum of 100 iterations is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metrics are defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "Y  = { 1.5N_y + 0.8Nn_y + 0.5C_y }\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "N  = { 1.5N_n + 0.8Nn_n + 0.5C_n }\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "- $N_y$ and $N_n$ represent the number of neighbors with labels YES and NO respectively.\n",
    "- $Nn_y$ and $Nn_y$ represent sum of the number of neighbors of each direct neighbor with labels YES and NO respectively.\n",
    "- $C_y$ and $C_n$ represent the number of neighbors of the YES centroid and NO centroid with labeles YES and NO respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The update of the centroids is done by choosing the member of the cluster with the highest number of neighbors with the same label as him.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see this algorithm as a variation of the label propagation where besides looking at direct neighbors we also look at level 2 neighbors as well as to the node of the group who has more labels that coincide with his. The idea is to give a higher scores when the group is more connected and the node is more connected to the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following graphs show the distribution of labels throughout the iterations of the algorithm for each case proposed on section 3.2. The algorithm would stop if no lables would change or if a maximum of 100 iterations was reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"spread_of_influence/figures/modified_lpa_m.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"spread_of_influence/figures/modified_lpa_m2.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that for the first case, the algorithm heavily benefits the cluster that initially has more members, therefore the NO cluster rapidly spreads to the network, and the YES cluster disappears after 5 iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we have a balanced seed the algorithm is much more conservative. For the M' case we can see that the YES cluster spreads more than the NO cluster, just like the original label propagation algorithm. If we take a closer look (graph below), using the log of the number of members per cluster we can see that the algorithm converges at around the 15th iteration, this seems a more realistic view of the spread of both groups. Even though the YES group spreads more, for the reasons explained on section 3.1, there should still be members of the NO group.\n",
